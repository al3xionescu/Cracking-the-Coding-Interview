/*
Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

int bitsSwapRequired(int a, int b){

We can make it better by continuously flipping the least significant bit and count how long it takes c to reach 0. The operation c = 
c & (c-1) will clear the least significant bit in c.


int bitsSwapRequired(int a, int b){
   int count = 0;
   for(int c = a^b; c!=0; c = c & (c-1)) {
      count++;
   }
   return count;
}
